<h1>Trying to transfer into CS</h1>

<p>
Ok, yeah, you really do need an A to transfer into CS Engineering,
and almost as high a grade for CS+X majors.
That can be a problem.


<p>
Right now, it's very VERY hard to transfer into the CS major.
I don't like the high grade requirements and neither does
anyone else in CS. 
But we don't have the resources
to admit everyone that would do well in the major.
So some perfectly reasonable students are not going to get in right now.
Sadly, that might end up including you.

<p>
The CS department hates this situation and 
is trying to get more resources.   
However, better resources probably won't appear
fast enough to help students currently trying to transfer.


<p>
Do as well as you can in CS 173 but <b> have a backup plan</b>.
If you are in another major, stay on track with its requirements.
Take the beginning courses in at least one other major.
Consider other CS-related majors here (e.g. the CS+X majors).
Check out other schools whose CS program you could transfer to.

<p>
Don't stress out over whether you will or
won't get the A.    Stress makes you perform less well.    Try
to put the grade issue out of your mind, as much as you can, and
concentrate on doing your best.   I know this is hard to do.

<p>
It is not the end of the world if you don't get into CS at UIUC.
Many schools with a somewhat lower ranking are quite good places
to do computer science.
Many jobs (even research jobs) benefit from expertise in CS plus
another field.    You can do well with
another major plus a CS minor.   A lot of CS researchers
and faculty members who did something else as their undergraduate
major, or went to a school outside the top-10.
