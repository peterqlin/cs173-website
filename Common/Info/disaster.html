<h1>Emergency Information</h1>

<p>College involves hard work but it&#39;s supposed to be fun and rewarding and not impossibly hard. If this isn&#39;t true for you, seek help. Don&#39;t be shy. Do not try to tough it out. Problems, even serious ones, are much more common than you think. That is why the campus has so many sources of help. Your problem can be solved. Keep trying different sources of help until you&#39;ve found an adequate solution.</p>

<p>Many problems can be solved by consulting your friends, the instructor, the course staff, other faculty you happen to know, and/or your departmental advising office. However, big problems often require external help. Sometimes you might need help from more than one place (e.g. mental and physical problems are often interconnected). Some useful contacts are below.</p>

<p>Please also keep your instructor informed about what&#39;s going on, if we can help or the problem is impacting your work in this course.</p>

<h3>But first ...</h3>

<p>If it is a health or safety emergency, call 911. Do not hesitate because you may have violated conduct rules (e.g. alcohol use). There are <a href="https://conflictresolution.illinois.edu/policies/medical-amnesty-and-good-samaritan/">amnesty policies</a> to protect you if you call for help.</p>

<p>If the sirens go off, that means there is a suspected tornado nearby. Go into the basement. If there is no basement, got to an interior room on a lower level.</p>

<p>Please do your part to help prevent the spread of Covid 19. Wear a mask. Don&#39;t go to class if you are sick. Report egregious violations of Covid 19 restrictions, e.g. a large party. Options include the Dean of Students office, the police, and the county public health. See numbers below.</p>

<p>If your problem relates to sexual misconduct, be aware that almost everyone working for the university is a &quot;mandated reporter&quot;. Please consult <a href="official-statements/mandated-reporter.html"> this statement</a> before deciding who to contact.</p>

<p>Make sure you are getting enough sleep, exercise, food. Even if something else is also wrong, skimping on these basics will make your problem harder to address.</p>

<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
