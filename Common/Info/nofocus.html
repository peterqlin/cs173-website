<h1>Focus problems</h1>

<p>
It's possible you just need to get yourself organized.   Buy a better alarm
clock.   Experiment with planner apps to find one that works for you.   
Remember all that organizational advice that the B students needed in high school,
but you could blow off because high school was easy?
College is harder, so now that advice applies to you as well.

<p>
But, also, this could be one of the other problems in disguise.

<ul>
<li>  Could you be in the
 <a href="wrongmajor.html"> wrong major?</a>
<li> <a href="overloaded.html"> Are you overloaded?</a>
<li> Could you have a
<a href="maybedres.html"> minor disability issue</a> slowing you down?
</ul>

<p>
All of these can mess up your ability to stay organized and keep your focus.
