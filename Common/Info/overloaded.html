<h1>Are you overloaded?</h1>

<p>
Back in high school, you were one of the top few students.
So you could take a massively ambitious set of classes and
still do well.    Maybe you were also doing theater and
a sport.   When you arrive at college, there's no way to
predict how heavy a load will really work, since your
classes are now harder.
You might be trying to do too much.

<p>
If your workload is cutting into your sleep, you definitely
have a load issue.   You cannot do technical work on insufficient
sleep.    The same applies if you are eating poorly, e.g. grabbing
quick junk food rather than having proper meals.

<p>
College is not a race.  It's important to take the right load and
do well at what you attempt.   You don't gain much by
finishing early or accumulating extra credits.

<p>
If this sounds like your situation, you need to lighten your load.
Drop a class or reduce your outside activities.
Speak to your advisor if you aren't sure which class is safe
to drop.   Avoid ending up with a schedule that consists entirely
of technical classes:   Gen Eds and outside activities help you
escape and stay sane.

<p>
Many medical conditions (including minor ones) 
can cause fatigue.  If there is
any chance of this, speak to the folks at McKinley.
