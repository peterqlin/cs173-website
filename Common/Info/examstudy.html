<h1>Studying for exams</h1>

<p>
There are three basic components to being prepared for a CS 173 exam.

<ul>
<li>  Understand concepts
<li>  Know factual material
<li>  Know standard outlines
</ul>

<p>
Your best approach on the concepts is to work problems.    Start with the
posted study problems.    But you can also look at similar problems
from the discussion booklet, or in old homeworks/exams posted on the web.
If you aren't sure how to do a problem, or aren't sure your solution is
correct, bring your work into office hours.


<p>
For the factual material, go through the exam's  skills list.   Look up
any items that you don't know.   Memorize anything that seems to suggest
memorization, e.g. basic facts and definitions.
A good mastery of this simple material will improve your speed and confidence
on the exam, as well as making sure you don't lose points due to small factual
errors.   
To make sure you are paying attention to the details,
write out the facts and/or say them out loud.   

<p>
To remember factual material, use a combination of understanding and
memorization.   In theory, either could work by itself.   However, in
practice, they support each other.
A partial understanding can be combined with a
partial memorization to reconstruct the right answer.


<p>
Worked solutions or written-out proofs are often long and complex.
The most important part is <b> the outline</b>.  
Even if the specific problem is different on the exam, the
same outline will often work.
If you can sketch the right outline for a problem, you can 
probably fill in the details.
Conversely, a badly chosen outline may make it hard for you
to complete the problem, especially under time pressure.

<p>
In studying the outline of a proof, the start and the end are most
important.  Also major steps or subsections, especially ones that have
labels/names.  When studying a solution, write out a short sketch of
the outline, to make sure you pay attention to it.  Look at several
problems of the same type and compare their outlines.  What parts
are the same?

<p>
Also keep an eye out for ways that you can check answers.   Are
there places that you could substitute small numbers and make sure
the answer is right?    Could you check small examples (e.g. for
a graph problem)?   Are there standard special cases you should 
check (e.g. zero size, negative size)?  
What types of objects does an operation
input/output?   

<p>
If you notice that you're skimming the material rather than reading it
properly, stop.  Skimming accomplishes very little.  Take a break.
Get something to eat.  Take a short walk.  Is it time to go to sleep?
Write down key facts as you read, to help keep yourself tracking.
