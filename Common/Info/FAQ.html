<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p><strong>I missed (or will miss) a Tutorial session, examlet, or homework&nbsp;- what do I do?</strong></p>

<p>See&nbsp;<a href="./missed-work.html">this page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PrairieLearn seems to be unenrolling me, or giving me weird access errors!</strong></p>

<p>You are probably in CS 128, which uses a separate PrairieLearn login. So log in again with your standard UIUC credentials (either in a different browser or after logging out of your 128 account).</p>

<p><strong>Which building is &quot;Siebel&quot;?</strong></p>

<p>If we ever forget to specify, we&#39;re talking about Siebel Center for Computer Science, not Siebel Center for Design.</p>

<p><strong>Regrades / broken questions</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We try to write questions with no errors and to grade with perfect accuracy. But, of course, we are only human. Mistakes happen and need to be corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>I haven&#39;t submitted the problem yet, but it&#39;s clearly self-contradictory (or otherwise broken)!</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">While our questions are sometimes broken, the vast majority of the time&nbsp;the question&#39;s fine and you are misreading it. It&#39;s not too late to figure out what it really means and get it right!&nbsp;Read it again, and make sure you&#39;re spending at least as much effort trying to figure out how <em>you</em> could be wrong as you spend trying to explain to us why <em>we&#39;re</em> wrong. (Though sometimes the latter is a good way to do the former - write out very explicitly why we&#39;re wrong, and then review your argument critically, looking for the weakest point.) If you still think it&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s a homework question, talk to us in office hours or Piazza; if it&#39;s an examlet, then take your best guess.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>I submitted the problem, and disagree with the grade I received (either the grading or the question seems wrong).</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">First look over the given solution&nbsp;and try to figure out on your own what went wrong. If our solution doesn&#39;t make sense, talk to us at office hours rather than submitting a regrade request. If after the previous steps you want to submit a regrade request, go to the question on PrairieLearn and click the &quot;Report an error in this question&quot; button.&nbsp;If the issue is with your grade rather than with the question, start your report with the words &quot;Regrade request:&quot;, and then tell us why the grading is incorrect (we don&#39;t accept just &quot;regrade request&quot;, &quot;please look at this again&quot;, etc&nbsp;with no explanation). Regrade requests might not be considered if submitted beyond one week from when we post grades for the assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Curving / letter grade cutoffs / extra credit</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">See <a href="./grading-formula-and-assigned-work.html">this page</a>. In particular,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Is an 87% enough for a B+? (etc)</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We do not guarantee any thresholds in advance other than the ones linked above. But in the last few&nbsp;semesters we&#39;ve used 80/83/87 for B-/B/B+ (same split for A and C;&nbsp;50/57/63 for D-/D/D+), and the&nbsp;<em>most likely&nbsp;</em>outcome is that the thresholds will be the same again this semester.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Is the course curved?</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">No.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Are individual assignments curved?</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">No.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Is there extra credit?</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">There was one small extra credit opportunity (announced during week 5 and 6 tutorial and on Piazza), and there may be a second, smaller one announced later. There isn&#39;t a way to do them late, and there will probably not be any others.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Are grades rounded up, e.g. is a 79.5 or a 79.95 the same as an 80?</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">No, we will use the precise score. (And relatedly, grades are not rounded <em>down</em>&nbsp;either - note that PrairieLearn might&nbsp;<em>display</em>&nbsp;rounded down scores, e.g. you might get an 84.9% on an examlet and it might show up as an 84%, but we will use the precise score in our final calculations.)</p>
