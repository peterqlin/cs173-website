<h1> Drop and then proficiency</h1>


<p>
Normally, it is a very bad idea to drop the class and try to get
past the requirement using the proficiency exam.   Two big dangers:

<ul>
<li> Although the proficiency exam has a low standard for passing
(currently B-), you'll need organized studying to pass it.   Is this
really feasible if you're having trouble in the regular class?

<li> You'll end up less prepared to take CS 374.    This is very
bad because CS 374 is quite hard.   (Ask upperclass majors.)

</ul>

<p>
This goes double if you are trying to transfer into the CS major,
because you'll need to substitute a later class for this one
when you apply to transfer.

<p>
Proficiency exams are designed primarily for placement early in the 
major when, among other things, it's still easy to take the class
if you don't pass the exam.    They make sense in two situations:

<ul>
<li>  You already know much of the material in the class.   E.g.
you are a math major who has taken Math 347.  Or you did a similar
course online for which you don't have official credit.
<li>  You're only doing a minor and this is the last CS theory
class you ever plan to take, so it's ok to just barely scrape through.
</ul>

<p>
If you are even thinking of going this route, make sure you have a
backup plan in case you don't pass the exam.
