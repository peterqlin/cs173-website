<h1>Having problems in CS 173</h1>

<p>
If you're not doing well in a course, you'd normally want to talk to
the instructor or perhaps your departmental advisor.  Lately, however,
overcrowding has made this hard to do.   So here are the most standard
sorts of advice we'd give you in person.  
Come see us if this isn't enough.


<h3>Are you really doing so badly?</h3>

<p>
How badly are you really doing?   In high school, you were one of the top
couple students and you could get all A's.    However, everyone in our CS
program was a top student in high school.   B is not a bad grade.    
If your high school preparation was iffy (e.g. your high school wasn't
the best), then you should worry even less about a B in this class.
It takes a few courses for differences in background to smooth away.

<p>
In this program, a reasonable goal is to get A's in the courses that
most interest you, especially your upper-level elective courses and
projects.   No one is very good at everything.   An employer or graduate
school will want you to show that you're very good at <b> something</b>.
Sure, a future theoretician should have an A in CS 173, but a future
prize-winning hardware designer might not.    Your first couple years
in college should be about finding the area of CS that suits you.

<p>
If you need to take CS 374 (i.e. CS and CE majors), a grade below B-
in CS 173 could be a real worry.   Finish the term as well as you can,
but also speak to your departmental advisor about whether to repeat
the class or take other theoretical classes (e.g. statistics) between
CS 173 and CS 374.

<p>
Special situations:

<ul>
<li>  <a href="transferhelp.html"> But I need an A to transfer into CS.</a>
<li>  <a href="wrongmajor.html"> It's not just the grade.   I'm finding
that I don't really like programming.</a>

</ul>


<h3>Why are you doing badly?</h3>


<p>
Do any of these seem to characterize your situation?   (More than one
might apply.)

<ul>
<li> I've been sick, have family issues, or some other life problem.
Speak to the instructor.   If it's serious/prolonged, also your advisor and the
Dean of Students (i.e. the
<a href="http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean/">
Emergency Dean</a> if it's an emergency, otherwise the
<a href="http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/student-assistance-center/">
Student Assistance Center</a>).

<li> Something really bad happened, e.g. my father died, I'm in the hospital, I was
assaulted, a tree fell on my house.   First deal with the immediate
problem.   See the <a href="disaster.html"> disaster page</a> for
helpful resources.   The
<a href="http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean/">
Emergency Dean</a> can connect you with sources of help
and they can keep your instructors informed.   


<li> I'm spending lots of time studying, staying up late at night,
but can't get all my work done.   
<a href="overloaded.html"> Are you overloaded?</a>

<li>  I feel like I understand the material and do well on homeworks, but
I keep running out of time on exams.   This also happens in other classes.
<a href="maybedres.html"> This could be a minor disability issue.</a>

<li>  <a href="drop-for-proficiency.html">
Would I be better off dropping the class and attempting the 
proficiency exam?</a>

<li> <a href="nofocus.html"> I'm having trouble remembering to do the
work.   It's hard to concentrate.</a>

<li> I'm doing all the <a href="doingwell.html">
recommended things</a> like going to office hours, but I'm not sure how to
<a href="examstudy.html"> study for the exams</a>.

</ul>
