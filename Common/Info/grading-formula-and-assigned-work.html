<h1>Grading Formula and assigned work for CS 173</h1>

<p>Your final average is a weighted combination of your averages on examlets and PrairieLearn assignments.&nbsp;Specifically</p>

<ul>
	<li>Examlets are worth 70%</li>
	<li>Final Exam is worth 20%</li>
	<li>The Pre-Unit Homework is worth 5%</li>
	<li>The Tutorials are worth 5%</li>
</ul>

<p>When we translate these averages into final letter grades, a score of 90 will be at least an A-, 80 at least a B-, 70 at least a C-, 50 at least a D-. If the raw scores are running excessively low, we may revise these cutoffs to be more generous. However, this has happened only very rarely in recent years. In recent terms, around three quarters of the grades have been A&#39;s and B&#39;s.</p>

<h3>Monitoring grades</h3>

<p>You are responsible for keeping an eye on your PrairieLearn gradebook and promptly reporting apparent errors. See the&nbsp;<a href="./FAQ.html">FAQ</a>&nbsp;for how to report grading and/or entry problems.</p>

<p>If the scores you are receiving alarm&nbsp;you,&nbsp;<a href="doingwell.html">seek help</a>.</p>

<h3>Readings and lectures</h3>

<p>Video lectures will be posted each week. However, you are also expected to prepare for each lecture by doing the posted readings. Basic material (e.g. basic definitions) is typically not covered in the videos. (The first-week videos are more comprehensive because we are just getting started.)</p>

<h3>Examlets</h3>

<p>There will be bi-weekly examlets -&nbsp;these account for most of your final course average. We plan 7&nbsp;bi-weekly examlets, each is 50 minutes long.</p>

<p><strong>Sign up for each examlet far in advance!</strong>&nbsp;The CBTF usually opens signups on <a href="https://us.prairietest.com/">PrairieTest</a> 11 days before each examlet. Timeslots may fill up, and we will not accept &quot;the CBTF ran out of timeslots&quot; as an excuse for missing an examlet.</p>

<p><strong>We do not drop any examlet scores.</strong>&nbsp;See the&nbsp;<a href="missed-work.html">missed work page</a>&nbsp;for how to arrange a makeup.</p>

<p>Before the first examlet, familiarize yourself with the&nbsp;<a href="exam-instructions.html">basic CS 173 exam instructions</a>. Only the most critical parts will be explicitly included on the individual exams.</p>

<p>Questions on examlets are sometimes exact copies of homework or study problems, or problems used in past terms. They might be entirely new. Or they might look similar to past problems but differ in critical details. We make no promises about whether you will or won&#39;t be doing a problem that you&#39;ve seen before. Similarly, makeups and retake exams may use previously-seen problems and/or new ones. Therefore, when studying for an examlet, concentrate on mastering general skills rather than memorizing specific solutions.</p>

<h3>Final Exam</h3>

<p>The final exam wil be similar in content to examlets but rather than just being on the most recent material will will be comprehensive and 1 hour and 50 minutes. It will be about twice the length of a standard examlet.</p>

<h3>Pre-Unit Homeworks</h3>

<p>Each week will have one Pre-Unit Checkpoint due Monday. These are autograded on PrairieLearn, and you can submit them as many times as needed to get full credit.</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>The Thursday lecture section each week will be a tutorial. In this you will be given a set of problems on the material that was covered in the lecture/discussion on Tuesday and you will be asked to work on them. This can be solo or in groups but to get credit you must write your own answer. This can either be in PrairieLearn where the problems will be given or on paper. You will be graded based on making a good faith attempt at the problem but you will also be given feedback as to how your answer would have been graded on an examlet. To do this there will be a large number of staff present on Thursday to help both recode your scores and give feedback.</p>

<p>To handle incidental issues that can come up your grade will be based only on your 10 highest scores.</p>
