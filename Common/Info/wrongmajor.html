<h1>Are you in the wrong major?</h1>

<p>
It's not a big deal if you don't especially like CS theory.  Maybe
that's just not your area of CS.  If you entered with no programming
or iffy math preparation, it's natural to struggle a bit at the start.
However, if you don't like any of your CS classes, esp. if you think
you just don't like programming, you might be in the wrong major.

<p>
<b> Don't make a hasty decision.</b>  You can stay in CS while
exploring the start of other majors.  Some people complete a major and
then switch to another area after college.  Some people do find that
it's just start-up issues and they have more fun in later courses.
Your early CS courses will still be useful even if you become a
chemist or a lawyer.  Keep your options open as long as possible.

<p>
It can be very hard to do well if you are in the wrong major.   
Few people can put enough effort into work that they don't like.
And then you'll be in a CS job after you graduate.   
So if you really don't like the field, it's important to switch
to a field you do like.

<p>
Many people change major.  This is normal.  You didn't have much
chance to learn about CS in high school, so how could you possibly be
sure it's the right choice?
It's even more normal if you picked CS because it's a hot field and
you're generally good at science and math.  Or if you picked CS
because a family member is good at it.  Sure, CS is fun but other
fields are fun too.   No field suits everyone.

<p>
Make some time in your schedule to explore options and think about
what suits you.  Work with your advisor.  Use summer break to get some
thinking time.  Use your Gen Ed slots to check out non-CS topics you
might like.

<p>
If you like CS somewhat, but can't see making it your whole life,
you might consider a hybrid CS+X major or another major with a
computational minor.   If it's hard to switch into the major you
want, you can do a CS major with a minor in the other field.
