<h2>Engineering College Statement on Sexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation</h2>

<p>The University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University&#39;s Title IX Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.</p>

<p>A list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found <a href="http://wecare.illinois.edu/resources/students/#confidential"> here</a>.</p>

<p>Other information about resources and reporting is available at <a href="http://wecare.illinois.edu"> We Care</a></p>
