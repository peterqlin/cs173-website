Engineering College Statement on Academic Integrity
</h2>

<p>
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Student Code 
should
also be considered as a part of this syllabus. Students should pay
particular attention to Article 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity. Read
the Code at the following URL: 
<a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/">
http://studentcode.illinois.edu/
</a>.

<p>
Academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade. Every student is
expected to review and abide by the Academic Integrity Policy:
<a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/"> 
https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/ </a>.
Ignorance is
not an excuse for any academic dishonesty. It is your responsibility
to read this policy to avoid any misunderstanding. Do not hesitate to
ask the instructor(s) if you are ever in doubt about what constitutes
plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.
