<h1>Academic integrity policy for CS 173</h1>

<p>We&#39;ve had very little cheating in this class and we&#39;d like it to stay that way. Cheating ruins the experience for everyone and we will pursue appropriate penalties if we catch someone cheating. Please don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also avoid actions which give the appearance of cheating. For example, avoid speaking with your friends during exams even on subjects unrelated to the exam. Such actions make other students nervous and may trigger unnecessary investigations by course staff.</p>

<p>You can find a general discussion of cheating, plagiarism, and the like on the <a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/"> university&#39;s web page</a>. See our <a href="grading-formula-and-assigned-work.html"> grading formula and assigned work page</a> for details about what sorts of help and collaboration are allowed on each type of work. You are expected to be familiar with these policies.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t sure whether some type of help or resource is ok to use, please consult the course staff. If you aren&#39;t sure you&#39;ve done the right thing, or you got a particularly large amount of help from course staff, or something unusual happens (e.g. a roommate blurts out advice that you didn&#39;t ask for), consult with us and/or write an explanation on your work. If you have made a good-faith attempt to acknowledge the help you received, you might not get full points but it won&#39;t be considered cheating or plagiarism.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t make a good-faith attempt to follow these policies, we may take action up to and including an academic integrity charge. Our standard penalty for cheating or plagiarism is a zero for the exam or assignment in question, plus lowering your final course grade by a whole letter grade. A second offense will typically cause you to fail the course.</p>

<p>The penalties for facilitating cheating or plagiarism, e.g. giving someone else the answer, depend on the circumstances. If the facilitation is deliberate, the facilitator may receive the same penalty as the person who did the copying.</p>

<p>Also notice that the department and college keep an electronic record of academic integrity cases. They may take more serious action if someone has prior offenses.</p>
