<h1>CS173: Missed Work</h1>
</div>

<p>A variety of situations might cause you to miss an examlet or other work. When the problem is minor (e.g. short virus), it&#39;s usually straightforward to make up.</p>

<h3>Major problems</h3>

<p>The rules on this page apply to minor problems, such as a brief illness. If you are experiencing major problems, contact your instructor <strong>promptly</strong> to work out a suitable plan.</p>

<p>Examples of larger problems would be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Extended illness</li>
	<li>Serious injury</li>
	<li>Serious family problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may ask you to provide documentation (e.g. a doctor&#39;s note). You should typically be working with DRES, your advisor, and/or the Dean of Students office. In particular, the Dean of Students office can help you inform instructors when you can&#39;t reasonably do so yourself (e.g. you&#39;re in the hospital), and provide confirmation of problems where you might not wish to tell us all the details.</p>

<h3>Missed homework</h3>

<p>Late homework will be accepted on PrairieLearn for partial credit: 85% credit for up to two days late, and 50% after that.&nbsp;You can contact the instructor to request the removal of this penalty in special circumstances, but in most situations this will be denied: you have several days to work on the homework and should get started early, so a last-minute issue like your computer breaking down&nbsp;the night it is due is not a valid excuse.</p>

<h3>Missed tutorial</h3>

<p>There will be ~13 tutorials and only your top 10 will count for your grade.</p>

<h3>Missed examlets</h3>

<p><u>Do not miss a CBTF reservation without cancelling it through PrairieTest first!</u> As long as you cancel in advance, you can simply pick a new time online. If you forget to cancel, then you will need to show up to the CBTF in person to reschedule.<br />
<br />
If you miss an examlet entirely (i.e. the Monday-Wednesday period for that examlet is over), or you are sure that you <em>will</em>&nbsp;miss the examlet (e.g. because you&#39;re quarantining for covid), then (in addition to cancelling any current reservation - see above)&nbsp;fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/ShUeScdvyDpjvqDV6">google form</a> as soon as<span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"> possible. <span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(32, 33, 36)">Note that you will need a compelling reason to have missed the exam in order to make it up. Later that day or the next</span>, we will either approve it (in which case you will see on PrairieTest that you are able to pick a new later date), or email you for more information.</span></span></p>

<h3>Acts of God</h3>

<p>We occasionally have outages in campus networks, power, or CS departmental servers. Weather sometimes disrupts operations and occasionally even shuts campus. Zoom can go down. And so forth. We will extend deadlines or make other arrangements as appropriate when there are long or awkwardly timed outages. However, we expect that you will download critical documents (e.g. exam study materials) in a timely manner and that you realize that support is very limited at night.</p>
