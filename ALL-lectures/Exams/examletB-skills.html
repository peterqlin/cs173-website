<h1>CS 173: Skills list for &quot;Examlet B&quot;</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Logic
	<ul>
		<li>Know what it means for a statement to be &quot;vacuously true.&quot;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modular arithmetic
	<ul>
		<li>For congruence mod k, know which integers are in the equivalence class of x. Know the shorthand notation [x]<sub>k</sub>&nbsp;(and the shorthand [x] for when k is clear from context).</li>
		<li>Know when [x]<sub>k</sub> and [y]<sub>k</sub> are equal as elements of Z<sub>k</sub>.</li>
		<li>Do arithmetic in Z<sub>k</sub> (e.g. addition, multiplication, taking integer powers), keeping intermediate results small.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set Theory
	<ul>
		<li>Notation
		<ul>
			<li>set builder notation for defining sets</li>
			<li>set membership (&isin;) and subset/inclusion (&sube;)</li>
			<li>special symbol for the empty set: &empty;</li>
			<li>an ordered pair, triple, n-tuple</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Define formally, be familiar with standard notation, compute the values for concrete input sets
		<ul>
			<li>A is a subset of B</li>
			<li>The cartesian product of two sets A and B, of three or more sets</li>
			<li>The cardinality of a set</li>
			<li>The complement of a set (given some specified universe).</li>
			<li>The union, intersection, and difference of two sets.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Know the meaning of the term disjoint.</li>
		<li>Know what happens if one of the inputs to these operations is the empty set.</li>
		<li>Given a simple set relationship, recognize whether it&#39;s correct or not. If not, show a counter-example.</li>

		<li>Cardinality
		<ul>
			<li>Know the inclusion-exclusion formula relating the cardinality of sets A and B to that of their union and intersection.</li>
			<li>Given the cardinality of two sets A and B, compute the cardinality of their Cartesian product.</li>
			<li>Apply these two formulas to real-world counting problems.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set Theory Proofs
	<ul>
		<li>Prove a set inclusion by choosing an element from the smaller set (while keeping it arbitrary!) and showing it&#39;s in the larger set.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<li>Collections of sets
	<ul>
		<li>Write simple proofs involving collections of sets and/or functions whose input and/or output values are sets.</li>
		<li>Interpret definitions for functions whose input and/or output values are sets (i.e. when the domain and/or co-domain is a power set).</li>
		<li>Interpret set-builder definitions of sets containing other sets.</li>
		<li>Given a specific set A, list the elements of its power set.</li>
		<li>Define the power set <img alt="\mathbb {P} " aria-hidden="true" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1053af9e662ceaf56c4455f90e0f67273422eded" style="background-color:rgb(248, 249, 250); border:0px; color:rgb(32, 33, 34); display:inline-block; font-family:sans-serif; font-size:14px; height:2.176ex; vertical-align:-0.338ex; width:1.42ex" />(A) for a set A.</li>
		<li>Manipulate sets containing other sets using standard set operations. (Be careful of getting the right number of brackets in examples involving the empty set and sets with only one element.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Partitions
	<ul>
		<li>Define a partition of a set A: be able to state the properties informally and also write them precisely in formal notation.</li>
		<li>Determine whether a specific set P is a partition of some specific set A.</li>
		<li>Know that the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on A form a partition of A.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Counting
	<ul>
		<li>Know the shorthand notation for binomial coefficients (number of combinations) and its definition in terms of factorials.</li>
		<li>Know the formula for computing the number of combinations of k objects from n types, with repetition.</li>
		<li>Know the Binomial Theorem and Pascal&#39;s Identity.</li>
		<li>Be able to solve practical counting problems involving combinations, combinations with repetition, and applications of the Binomial Theorem.</li>
