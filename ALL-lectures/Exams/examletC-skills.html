<h1>CS 173: Skills list for &quot;Examlet C&quot;</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Functions
	<ul>
		<li>Know the basic notation f:A&rarr;B. Know the meaning of the terms domain, co-domain, image (of the function), pre-image (of a value in B).</li>
		<li>Define the composition of two functions. Compute the composition of two specific functions.</li>
		<li>Identify when a formula or diagram defines something that is not a function (e.g. two output values for a single input).</li>
		<li>Define the identity function id<sub>A&nbsp;</sub>on a set A</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>One-to-one and Onto
	<ul>
		<li>Define what it means for a function function to be one-to-one, onto, bijective, increasing, strictly increasing.</li>
		<li>Be able to identify whether a function (presented via a formula, diagram, or other method) has one of these properties.</li>
		<li>Prove that a function has one of these properties.</li>
		<li>Prove general results about these properties, e.g. a strictly increasing function is one-to-one, composition of two one-to-one functions is one-to-one.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Logic and proofs
	<ul>
		<li>Understand how to simplify proofs using &quot;without loss of generality&quot;</li>
		<li>Negate a statement containing multiple quantifiers.</li>
		<li>Understand the difference in meaning between the statement &forall; x, &exist; y P(x,y) and the statement &exist; y, &forall; x, P(x,y).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Counting
	<ul>
		<li>Know the formulas for counting permutations, and permutations with indistinguishable objects.</li>
		<li>Apply permutation formulas to count the numbers of possible functions or one-to-one functions between sets of specific sizes.</li>
		<li>Know how a function being onto or one-to-one constrains the size of its domain relative to its co-domain. (Finite sets only.)</li>
		<li>Apply these formulas to solve simple concrete word problems.</li>
		<li>Apply the&nbsp;Pigeonhole Principle to simple concrete examples.</li>
		<li>Apply the Pigeonhole Principle in writing proofs (straightforward examples only).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Graph basics
	<ul>
		<li>Know that a graph is a set of vertices/nodes plus a set of edges.</li>
		<li>Know what a loop and a multi-edge are, that a &quot;simple graph&quot; has neither, and that graphs in this class are simple unless we specify otherwise.</li>
		<li>Know how to name edges via their endpoints, e.g. vw or {v,w}.</li>
		<li>Be able to specify a walk using an edge sequence and/or node sequence.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Graph terminology and notation
	<ul>
		<li>Basics: adjacent/neighboring vertices, endpoints of an edge, edge connecting (incident with) two vertices, degree of a vertex, subgraph</li>
		<li>Special example graphs: K<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, W<sub>n</sub>, K<sub>n,m</sub>. Know shorthand, full names, structure, numbers of vertices and edges. Beware: W<sub>n</sub>&nbsp;contains n+1 vertices, and&nbsp;K<sub>n,m</sub> is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the same thing as a normal complete graph.</li>
		<li>Walks: walk, open walk, closed walk, cycle, path.</li>
		<li>Connectivity: connected graph, connected component, cut edge, acyclic.</li>
		<li>Distances: length of a path (number of edges in it), distance between two nodes, diameter of a graph.</li>
		<li>Other facts and concepts: Euler circuit, Handshaking theorem, bipartite graph</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Graph properties
	<ul>
		<li>Find the number of connected components in a graph</li>
		<li>Determine if a graph has an Euler circuit (all vertices in the graph must have even degree).</li>
		<li>Count the number of paths between two fixed nodes</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Graph isomorphism
	<ul>
		<li>Prove that two graphs are isomorphic by giving a bijection between their vertices.</li>
		<li>Count the number of isomorphisms between two graphs.</li>
		<li>Prove that two graphs are not isomorphic by finding a feature that differs, e.g. different numbers of nodes/edges, different numbers of vertices with a specific degree k, small subgraph present in one graph but not in the other.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
