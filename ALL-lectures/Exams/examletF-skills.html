<h1>CS 173: Skills list for &quot;Examlet F&quot;</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Algorithms
	<ul>
		<li>Be familiar with the overall structure and big-O running times of the following algorithms.
		<ul>
			<li>merge two sorted lists</li>
			<li>binary search</li>
			<li>merge sort</li>
			<li>graph reachability (what&#39;s in x&#39;s connected component)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Given an unfamiliar but fairly simple function in pseudo-code, analyze how long it takes using big-O notation. You should be able to analyze nested for loops, recursive functions, and simple examples of while loops.</li>
		<li>For an algorithm involving loops (perhaps nested), express its running time using summations.</li>
		<li>Given a recursive algorithm (familiar or unfamiliar) express its running time as a recursive definition.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
