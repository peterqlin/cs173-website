<h1>CS 173: Skills list for &quot;Examlet D&quot;</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Graph coloring
	<ul>
		<li>Know that a (vertex) coloring of a graph is labelling of each vertex with a color, such that adjacent vertices always have different colors.</li>
		<li>Know that the chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors required to color it.</li>
		<li>Know the shorthand notation &chi;(G).</li>
		<li>Know that graph coloring is useful for (among other things) register allocation in compilers for programming languages like C and Java.</li>
		<li>Know that if D is the maximum degree of any vertex in a graph G, then G can be colored with D+1 colors.</li>
		<li>Know that the &quot;greedy&quot; coloring algorithm often produces pretty good colorings fast, but is not guaranteed to produce the best solution.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Two-way bounding
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the difference between an exact result, an upper bound, and a lower bound.</li>
		<li>Prove an equality by establishing upper and lower bounds. E.g. prove that the chromatic number of a graph G is n.</li>
		<li>Prove a set equality by proving inclusion in both directions.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Summations
	<ul>
		<li>Know how to read summation notation, i.e. convert between it and a list of terms with ellipsis (...). Same for product notation.</li>
		<li>Extract the first or last term in a sum or product.</li>
		<li>Rewrite a sum or product so that its index variable starts at a different number.</li>
		<li>Know the closed form for the sum of the first n positive integers.</li>
		<li>Know the closed form for a geometric series, especially two common&nbsp;cases: sum of (1/2)<sup>k</sup> and sum of 2<sup>k</sup>.</li>
		<li>Know how to adjust a closed form for changes in the start/end index values.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>(Easy) Induction
	<ul>
		<li>Given a claim, identify/state the key parts of an inductive proof: the induction variable, the claim P(n), base case, inductive step, inductive hypothesis, conclusion of the inductive step.</li>
		<li>Be able to state a (strong) inductive hypothesis. (We always use and require strong hypotheses in this class, but some of you may have used weak hypotheses in other classes.)</li>
		<li>Use induction to prove a formula (equality or inequality) is correct for all integers starting at some base case.</li>
		<li>Use induction to prove that a non-formula claim (e.g. a divisibility relation) holds for all integers starting at some base case.</li>
		<li>Any proofs for this first half of the examlet will have very simple structure. In particular, the truth of the claim at n=k depends only on the claim being true at n=k-1, with only one base case required&#8203;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Recursive definition
	<ul>
		<li>Understand how to read a recursive definition, e.g. compute selected values or objects produced by that definition.</li>
		<li>Know that a recursive definition requires both a base case (or cases) and a&nbsp;recursive step/formula.</li>
		<li>Define the Fibonacci numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>&#8203;Unrolling
	<ul>
		<li>Given a recursively defined function, find its closed form by &quot;unrolling&quot;. Test questions will involve either doing certain key steps or a very simple example, not an entire long messy unrolling.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Induction
	<ul>
		<li>Write inductive proofs that need to use the truth of the claim for more than one immediately previous value, e.g. multiple previous values, a previous value several steps back.</li>
		<li>Determine whether an inductive proof requires more than one base case and, if so, which ones.</li>
		<li>Use induction to prove facts about a recursively defined function, e.g. that it has some specific closed form.<font color="red">&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;</font></li>
