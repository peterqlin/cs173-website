	<h2>Relations 2 </h2>
</div>


<hr>

  <p>
    In this video, we'll see sample proofs of two relation
    properties.   (The other three properties have proof outlines
    that are more straightforward.)

<h2>Our sample relation</h2>


<p>
Let's remember our sample relation with triples from the previous
video.   We defined \( V = \{0, 1, \ldots, 10\}\), i.e. integers
between 0 and 10.  The base set for our relation was the
set of triples from V, i.e. \(T = V^3\).

<p>
We defined an define an order \(\preceq \) on \(T\) that tells us when 
set of triples is better than another:

<blockquote>
\((a,b,c) \preceq (x,y,z)\) iff  \(a\le x\), \(b \le y\), and \(c\le z\)

</blockquote>


<h2>Transitive</h2>

<blockquote>
Defn: A relation R on a base set A is transitive iff  for every \(x,y,z\in A\), if
  \(xRy\) and \(y R z\), then \(x R z\).
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that our definition of transitive is an if/then statement. 
The base set in our relation is T (not A).   So 
the three elements x, y, and z mentioned in the definition will be triples of
integers. To make this clear, let's call them \(x = (a,b,c)\),
\(y = (i,j,k)\), and \(z = (p,q,r)\).

<p>
 To prove that \(\preceq\) is transitive, we use the standard direct
 proof outline.  That is, declare our variables, assume everything in
 the hypothesis of the if/then statements, and put the conclusion
 down at the end of our draft proof.

<blockquote>
Proof:  let \((a,b,c)\),
\((i,j,k)\), and \((p,q,r)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\)  and
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (p,q,r)\). <br>
<p>
... <br>

<p>
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (p,q,r)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now substitute in the definition of the relation \(\preceq\).
  Remember to do that at the bottom of the proof as well as the top,
  so we've converted our statements about \(\preceq\) into bits of algebra.

<blockquote>
Proof:  let \((a,b,c)\),
\((i,j,k)\), and \((p,q,r)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\)  and
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (p,q,r)\). <br>

<p>
  By the definition of \(\preceq\),
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) means that
  \(a \le i\), \(b \le j\), and \(c \le k\).
  Similarly 
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (p,q,r)\) means that
  \(i \le p\), \(j \le q\), and \(k \le r\).
<p>
... <br>

<p>
So  \(a \le p\), \(b \le q\), and \(c \le r\).
By the definition of \(\preceq\), this means that
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (p,q,r)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>


<p>
Fortunately, the algebra is easy to connect:

<blockquote>
Proof:  let \((a,b,c)\),
\((i,j,k)\), and \((p,q,r)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\)  and
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (p,q,r)\). <br>

<p>
  By the definition of \(\preceq\),
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) means that
  \(a \le i\), \(b \le j\), and \(c \le k\).
  Similarly 
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (p,q,r)\) means that
  \(i \le p\), \(j \le q\), and \(k \le r\).

<p>
Since 
\(a \le i\) and \(i \le p\), \(a \le p\).
Since  \(b \le j\) and \(j \le q\), \(b \le q\).
Since \(c \le k\) and \(k \le r\), \(c \le r\).
   

<p>
So  \(a \le p\), \(b \le q\), and \(c \le r\).
By the definition of \(\preceq\), this means that
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (p,q,r)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>


<h2>Antisymmetric</h2>

<p>
  Now let's prove that this relation is antisymmetric.   Remember that we
  have two equivalent definitions of antisymmetric.   The first one is easier
  to understand, but the second "alternate" definition 
  works much better for writing proofs.

<blockquote>
  Original Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff  for every \(x,y\in A\), if
  \(xRy\) and \(x \not = y\), then \(y \not Rx\).
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
  Alternate Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff
  for every \(x,y\in A\), if \(xRy\) and \(y  Rx\), 
  then \(x  = y\).
</blockquote>

<p>
So let's use the second definition and sketch our standard direct proof outline.  
Remember that we're using \(x = (a,b,c)\) and \(y = (i,j,k)\) to show the
triplet structure.

<blockquote>
Proof:  Let \((a,b,c)\) and \((i,j,k)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
\((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) and 
\((i,j,k) \preceq (a,b,c)\).

<p>
  .... <br>

<p>
Then \((a,b,c) = (i,j,k)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now substiute in the definition of \(\preceq\):

<blockquote>
Proof:  Let \((a,b,c)\) and \((i,j,k)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
\((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) and 
\((i,j,k) \preceq (a,b,c)\).

<p>
  By the definition of \(\preceq\),
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) means that
   \(a \le i\), \(b \le j\), and \(c \le k\).
 Similarly
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (a,b,c)\) means that
  \(i \le a\), \(j \le b\), and \(k \le c\).


<p>
  .... <br>

<p>
Then \((a,b,c) = (i,j,k)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now look at the algebra needed to connect the top and bottom.
  As with the transitive proof,
  there's not much missing.

<blockquote>
Proof:  Let \((a,b,c)\) and \((i,j,k)\) be elements of T.
Suppose that 
\((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) and 
\((i,j,k) \preceq (a,b,c)\).

<p>
  By the definition of \(\preceq\),
  \((a,b,c) \preceq (i,j,k)\) means that
   \(a \le i\), \(b \le j\), and \(c \le k\).
 Similarly
  \((i,j,k) \preceq (a,b,c)\) means that
  \(i \le a\), \(j \le b\), and \(k \le c\).

<p>
  Since \(a \le i\) and \(i \le a\), \(a = i\).
  Since \(b \le j\) and \(j \le b\),  \(b = j\).
Since \(c \le k\) and \(k \le c\), \(c = k\).

<p>
  Since \(a = i\), \(b = j\), and \(c = k\), 
\((a,b,c) = (i,j,k)\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>


<p>
  Always use this alternate outline.   Although the original intuitive
  definition can theoretically be used in proofs, it typically leads
  to problems filling in the middle section with correct math.
