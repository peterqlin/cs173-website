<h2>Diagonalization</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Now let's prove that there are uncountable sets.    
    
<blockquote>
Claim:   the set of all infinite binary sequences is uncountable.
</blockquote>

<p>
These are sequences of 0's and 1's that keep going forever on the righthand end.   

<p>
We're going to use proof by contradiction.   So suppose that the set of infinite binary
sequences is countable.    That means that we can put all infinite binary
sequences into a list indexed by the
natural numbers: \(S_0, S_1, S_2, \ldots\).

<p>
The trick we'll use to show a contradiction is called "diagonalization" and is due to Cantor.

<p>  We'll write out our list of infinite
sequences.  I'm picking some random values for the sequences to illustrate what's happening, but
the actual proof doesn't depend on the specific values.

<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization1.png">

<p>
Now, let's make a new infinite bit vector X from the values on the diagonal of this chart.    That is
\(X(k) = S_k(k)\).

<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization2.png">

<p>
Now let's define a vector Y that has exactly the opposite bit values as X.
Depending on whether you lean towards math or low-level programming, you might write this as
\(Y(k) = 1- S_k(k)\) or as 
\(Y(k) =  not(S_k(k))\).

<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization3.png">


<p>
Y can't be any of the vectors in our list \(S_0, S_1, S_2, \ldots\).   Suppose we pick some vector
\(S_k\) on the list.    Then Y and \(S_k\) have different values at position k.   So they aren't equal.   

<p>
  So we have a contradiction:   we assumed
  that our list contained all infinite binary sequences, but
Y isn't on the list.   Therefore, we must have been wrong in our assumption the set was countable.


<p>
Yes, this is an extremely odd claim and an unusual sort of proof.   So you may need some time to get used to
it.   If you don't feel like you completely understand it by the end of this term, you'll get a second chance
when you take CS 374.



<hr>
<h2>Uncountable sets closely related to bit vectors</h2>
<hr>

<p>
There's a couple immediate consequences of this theorem, largely because we can choose to see
a bit vector in several different ways.

<p>
First, we can think of an infinite bit vector as a function from \(\mathbb{N}\) to {0,1}.  
Each position in the vector becomes an input to the function.   So the set of all functions
from \(\mathbb{N}\) to {0,1} is uncountable.  

<p>
An infinite bit vector can also be used to represent a set S of natural numbers.
Each position in the bit vector tells us whether the corresponding natural number is in
S.   In the example below, S contains 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9, but not 2,3,4, 7, 8, 10, 11.
For a finite subset, the vector would become all zeroes after a certain point.   

<table rules = all frame=box cellpadding =5>
  <tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>...</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>...</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>
Each subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) corresponds to exactly one infinite bit vector, and vice versa.
So, since the set of all infinite bit vectors is uncountable, 
\(\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{N})\) is also uncountable.


<hr>
<h2> \(\mathbb{R}\)  is uncountable </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Now, let's show that the interval (0,1) frome the reals is not countable, which will
  imply that the full set of reals is uncountable.   You might think that we could simply
  interpret a bit vector as the fractional part of a number.   However, remember that
  each number ending in all zeroes is equivalent to a closely-related number ending in all
  1's.   To avoid complex discussion about whether this is or isn't a problem, let's do a
  second diagonalization proof, tweaking a few details.

<p>
  For this proof, we'll represent each number in base-10.    So suppose that (0,1) is 
   countable.   Then we can make a list
  of all numbers in (0,1) indexed by the integers:   \(R_0, R_1, R_2, \ldots \).   
  Here's a picture:
  
<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization6.png">

<p>
Here's our diagonal number X:

<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization7.png">

<p>
  To avoid issues with trailing 0's and 9's, let's make our new number Y by
  mapping each digit 3 to a 4, and then every other digit to 3.   For this
  example, we'd have \(Y = 0.43343...\).    Y can't be equal to any number \(R_k\)
  in the list, because it differs from \(R_k\) at the kth position after the
  decimal point.   And the difference doesn't involve swapping 0 and 9, so it's
  not a case where the two decimal representations might be equivalent.

<p>
We have a contradiction:
we assumed we had a list of all numbers in (0,1)
but we've constructed a number Y that isn't in the list.   So (0,1) isn't
  countable.


<hr>
<h2>Why can't you do this with the rational numbers?</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Suppose we considered a smaller set T that contains
bit vectors that become all zeroes after a certain point.  
Let's look at where a diagonalization proof would fail.
We can put the elements of T into a list and construct our vector Y.   However,
Y is not guaranteed to be in the set T, because it might not end with zeroes.
For example, suppose we order T by the length of the section up through the last one.


<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization4.png">

<p>
With this ordering, Y will end up entirely filled with 1's.   So it's not in the set T.

<p>
<img width=400 src="countability-figs/diagonalization5.png">

<p>
Even if we extend T to include sequences that end in repeating patterns (e.g. like certain
rational numbers), we'll have the same problem making the proof go through.    The proof works
for the full set of infinite, or for the reals, because they are big enough and unconstrained
enough that our constructed vector Y must still live in the set.


<hr>
<h2>More uncountable sets </h2>
<hr>

<p>
If we enlarge an uncountable set, the result will be uncountable.   
So, for example, the set of all functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to {0,1}
is uncountable, so the larger
set of all functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to {0,1,2,3}
is uncountable.
Since the names of the output values don't matter, 
the set of all functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to any set A is uncountable,
as long as A has at least two elements.

<p>
If a set X incorporates all of an uncountable set, then S will be uncountable.
For example, the complex numbers are uncountable because they contain the reals
as a subset.  The set of trees with real number labels on the nodes
is uncountable.  Even though the reals aren't a subset of this set of trees,
we can pick out (at least) one tree that corresponds to each real number.

<p>
  You do need to make sure your construction is using the whole uncountable
  set (e.g. the reals) or a large enough section of it (e.g. the positive
  reals, the interval (0,1)).   Consider the set
  P= {\(\pi\), e, \(\sqrt{\pi}\), 4,7}.   Although there are three irrational
  numbers in the set P, P still has only five members.  So P is countable.

<p>
Our diagonalization proof used the natural numbers to index the list of bit vectors
or the list of real numbers.  The method will also work for other choices of index
set.   So we can use the method to show that
\(\mathbb{P}(A)\) is larger than A, for any set A (finite or infinite).
And \(\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{P}(A))\) is  larger than \(\mathbb{P}(A)\).
So there are an infinite number of infinite cardinalities.  (Mindblowing!)
