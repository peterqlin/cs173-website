<h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>

<p>
  So far, we've seen state diagrams with a finite number of states.   But some of the
  most interesting applications involve infinite state spaces.    A good example is
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> 
 John Conway's Game of Life</a>.  It's actually a little simulator, very loosely motivated by
  the behavior of populations.   The player gets to input the 
  starting state and then the rules take over.

<p>
  The playing space is an infinite checkerboard.   You start by marking soem cells as
  "live".   When moving from step to step, you consider the eight neighbors of each cell
  (i.e. diagonal neighbors count).

  <ul>
  <li>  A cell with 0-1 live neighbors, or 4-8 live neighbors, stays/becomes dead.
  <li>  A cell with 2 live neighbors keeps its current status.
  <li>  A cell with 3 live neighbors stays/becomes live.
  </ul>

<p>
  Here's a simulator that we can play with:

  <ul>
<li> <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/"> simulator</a>
by Edwin Martin (edwin@bitstorm.org)
  </ul>

<p>
This starting configuration dies away:

  <pre>
  XXX
  X X
  </pre>

<p>
This one doesn't change:

  <pre>
    XX
   X  X
    XX   
  </pre>

<p>
This one turns into an oscillator:

  <pre>
    X
   XXX
    X   
  </pre>


The 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> 
   wikipedia page</a> has a collection of fun patterns that you can  put into the
 simulator..

<h2>Gliders</h2>

<p>
When the game was published in Scientific American in 1970, there was a big
interest in working out patterns that would do fun things.    For example,
the "glider" (below) moves across the board.  
A lot of this had to be worked out on graph paper, because there were very few
computers and they were very primitive.

    X X
     XX
     X   
  </pre>


<p>
  You can argue about whether a glider needs an infinite state space.   Perhaps
  we can simply re-normalize the playing field so that it follows the glider.
  However, if your starting configuration contains a non-moving object as well
  as the glider, then the state space is clearly infinite because the distance
  between the two objects increases without bound.

<p>
  Even more interesting is a glider gun, first produced by Bill Gosper.   This
  generates an increasing sequence of gliders, so that the number of live cells
  in the system increases.

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>
  Notice that a Game of Life configuration does one of three things:

  <ul>
<li> "Halts": It stops changing after a while.
<li> "Repeats": It gets into a repeating loop after a while.
<li> "Aperiodic": The configuration keeps changing but it's not returning to the same
  configuration.
  </ul>

<p>
  If we just had the first two types of behavior, we could watch the system for a while
  and it would eventually halt or repeat a state.   However, it's not clear how to tell
  whether the system is aperiodic or we just haven't waited long enough to see a halt
  or repeated state.

<p>
  Closely related to the aperiodic behavior is the fact that you can
  simulate a Turing Machine, i.e.  a very simple stripped-down
  computer, using the Game of Life.
