	<h2>Relations 1 </h2>
</div>


<hr>

  <p>
    In this video, we'll look at the five basic relation properties,
    including how to apply them in special situations.


<h2>Basics</h2>

  <p>
    A relation is defined on a base set.  This could be a large set
    like the real numbers.  The examples in this video will use small
    finite base sets.  In this class, we'll assume that the base set
    is not empty (i.e. has something in it).

  <p>
    Here's a picture of relation R on the set {1,2,3,4}.   The arrows
    show which (ordered) pairs of elements are related.
    I've added arrows more-or-less at random.  E.g. 3 and 4 are related to themselves
    but 1 and 2 aren't.   This is still a legitimate mathematical relation,
    but one that doesn't have many useful properties.

  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/random-relation.png">


  <p>
    Here is the "divides but not equal" relation on the set B={2,3,4, 6, 12}
    Notice that the relation has a more uniform structure.   For example, none
    of the elements has a self-loop.   There are no pairs of values connected
    in both directions.
  The five basic relation properties will help us make that intuition precise,
  by calling out specific patterns of behavior.

  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/divides.png">


<h2>Reflexive and Irreflexive</h2>

  <p> Here are the formal definitions for "reflexive" and "irreflexive".
(Notice the slash through the relation symbol in the definition of irreflexive.)

<blockquote>
  Defn: A relation R on a base set A is reflexive iff  for every \(x\in A\), \(xRx\).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Defn: A relation R on a base set A is irreflexive iff  for every \(x\in A\),  \(x \not R x\).
</blockquote>

  <p>
    In pictures, every node (i.e. element in the base set)
    in a reflexive relation has a self loop (left).
   Every node in an irreflexive relation does not have a self loop (right).

  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/reflexive.png">
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/irreflexive.png">

  <p>
   The main gotcha with reflexive and irreflexive is that
    there is an intermediate possibility:  a relation in which some nodes have self-loops
    and some don't.   Such a relation is not reflexive and also not irreflexive.
    So the two properties are not opposites.

  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/not-reflexive.png">


<h2>Symmetric and Antisymmetric</h2>

  <p>
    Here's the definition of "symmetric."

<blockquote>
  Defn: A relation R on a base set A is symmetric iff  for every \(x,y\in A\), if
  \(xRy\), then \(yRx\).
</blockquote>

  <p>
    This definition says that if we have an arrow in one direction, there must also
    be a reverse arrow.   So we can't have an arrow in only one direction.
    However, it's ok to have no arrows between a pair of nodes.   The definition 
    contains an if/then statement whose hypothesis is false in that situation, so
    the if/then statement is vacuously true.
    

  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/symmetric-local.png">

    

<p>
  Here's a picture of a relation that's symmetric (but not reflexive or irreflexive).

  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/symmetric.png">



  <p>
    A relation is antisymmetric if nodes are connected in only one direction, or perhaps
    not connected at all.
So the local possibilities look like this:


  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/antisymmetric-local.png">

  <p>
    It's very tempting to define it this way:

<blockquote>
  Buggy Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff  for every \(x,y\in A\), if
  \(xRy\), then \(y \not Rx\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  However, in mathematics, it's always possible that two variables with different names
  secretly have the same value.   This is called "aliasing" when it happens in computer
  programs.   Let's try substituting \(x=y\) into the above definition:

<blockquote>
  for every \(x \in A\), if   \(xRx\), then \(x \not Rx\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  So this definition would have an unintended consequence:  an antisymmetric
  relation could never be reflexive.    So let's restrict our definition of
  antisymmetric to talk only about a pair of base values that are distinct
  from one another:

<blockquote>
  Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff  for every \(x,y\in A\), if
  \(xRy\) and \(x \not = y\), then \(y \not Rx\).
</blockquote>


<p>
  As with reflexive and irreflexive, there are relations that are neither
  symmetry nor antisymmetric, because they have a mixture of the two
  configurations:

  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/not-symmetric.png">


  <p>
    Because of vacuous truth, we have a fourth possibility.
    The relation below is both symmetric and antisymmetric.   
    The if/then statements in both definitions are true because
    there no pair of distinct base values connected by an arrow.

  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/symmetric-antisymmetric.png">

<h2>Antisymmetric:  alternate definition</h2>

  <p>
   Proofs of antisymmetry typically use a different, equivalent definition:

<blockquote>
  Original Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff  for every \(x,y\in A\), if
  \(xRy\) and \(x \not = y\), then \(y \not Rx\).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Alternate Defn:  A relation R on a base set A is antisymmetric iff
  for every \(x,y\in A\), if \(xRy\) and \(y  Rx\), 
  then \(x  = y\).
</blockquote>

  <p>
    You can get between the two forms using a series of logical transformations.
    The critical step is converting a statement into its contrapositive.

<blockquote>
  if \(xRy\) and \(x \not = y\), then \(y \not Rx\) <br>
  if \(xRy\), then (if \(x \not = y\), then \(y \not Rx)\) <br>
  if \(xRy\), then (if \(y Rx\), then x = y) &nbsp;&nbsp; <-- contrapositive      <br>
  if \(xRy\) and \(y Rx\), then x = y <br>
</blockquote>

  <p>
You can paraphrase this new form as "the only way for x and y to be related in both
directions is for x and y to be secretly the same value."


<h2>Transitive</h2>

  <p>
You've seen transitivity before, in the special case of order relations (e.g. \(\le\)) on the real numbers.   Here's the general definition for any relation R:

<blockquote>
Defn: A relation R on a base set A is transitive iff  for every \(x,y,z\in A\), if
  \(xRy\) and \(y R z\), then \(x R z\).
</blockquote>

  <p>
    Suppose that we have two arrows that connect end to end.
In that case, we must have a "shortcut" arrow that goes directly from the first
value to the last one:

  <p>
    <img width=150 src="relation-figs/transitive-local-1.png">


  <p>
    So the situation on the left below is clearly good and the one on the right
    is bad:

  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/transitive-local-2.png">

<p>
However, notice that the condition in the hypothesis
(\(xRy\) and \(y R z\)) is very specific.   When we have any other
configuration of arrows, the if/then statement is vacuously true.
So all of the following local situations are consistent with
the relation being transitive:

  <p>
    <img width=350 src="relation-figs/transitive-local-3.png">


  <p>
    There are a lot of ways to be transitive, but only one local configuration that
    makes a relation not transitive.    So if you're trying to decide whether a
relation is transitive, it's best to look for local evidence that it's not transitive.


<h2>Aliasing and transitivity</h2>


<p>
Look at the two local configurations below?   Are they consistent with the
relation being transitive?


  <p>
    <img width=200 src="relation-figs/transitivity-aliasing.png">

<p>
These are actually violations of transitivity, because of aliasing.   To see this, we
need to set x=z in our definition of transitive:

<blockquote>
for every \(x,y\in A\), if \(xRy\) and \(y R x\), then \(x R x\)
</blockquote>

  <p>
    <img width=250 src="relation-figs/transitivity-aliasing-2.png">


<p>
So if we have arrows connecting two nodes in both directions, transitivity
requires a self-loop on both nodes.


<h2>Partial orders</h2>
    
<p>
Certain combinations of relation properties are particularly useful.
A relation is a "partial order" if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and
transitive.   Partial orders are a bit like the normal \(\le\) ordering
on the real numbers, but somewhat looser.   This will make the most
sense if we look at an example.

<p>
Suppose that we are representing character properties in a video
game.   We'd like to give each character a triple of values
(charm, strength, health).   Traditionally, each of these is
an integer between 0 and 10.   
So if we set  \( V = \{0, 1, \ldots, 10\}\) then the
set of triples will be \(T = V^3\).

<p>
Now, let's define an order \(\preceq \) on \(T\) that tells us when 
one character's status is better than another's:

<blockquote>
\((a,b,c) \preceq (x,y,z)\) iff  \(a\le x\), \(b \le y\), and \(c\le z\)

</blockquote>


<p>
Here's a little piece of the relation:

  <p>
    <img width=350 src="relation-figs/triples-relation.png">

  <p>
    Notice that (10,8,6) is definitely better than (2,8,5), (2,4,3), and
    (10,6,5).   However, our definition doesn't state whether
    (2,8,5) is better or worse than (10,6,5).   And that's what we want for
    our application, because it's genuinely not clear whether extra charm
is better than extra strength.  
These missing relationships are what makes this a "partial" order, as compared to
a "total" or "linear" order like \( \le\)  on the real numbers.

<p>
This relation is obviously reflexive.  
  In the next video, we'll prove that this relation is also antisymmetric and transitive.   


<h2>Equivalence relations</h2>

<p>
  Another particularly useful pattern of relation properties is reflexive, symmetric,
  and transitive.   Relations with these three properties are called "equivalence
  relations."   

<p>
  For example, consider musical chords.   Here are standard C and D chords.

  <p>
    <img width=300 src="relation-figs/chords-1.png">

  <p>
    But there are other possible C and D chords, e.g. we can choose to replace the
    low C or D with the similar note an octave higher, as shown below.   There are
    subtle differences, but a beginning guitar player doesn't care about them.

  <p>
    <img width=300 src="relation-figs/chords-2.png">

  <p>
    We can define a "beginning guitar"  equivalence relation by saying that
    two chords are "equivalent" if they contain the same named notes.   E.g.
    any chord containing D, F# and A is a "D chord" regardless of whether I
    choose to make it using a high D or a low D.   Then, when we write out our
    music, we can just write "D" and let the player choose some appropriate
    fingering.   We've lost some detail, but the notation is very compact and
    easy to read.

<p>
  This is an example of the main application for equivalence relations:
  making new objects 
  fusing together a number of equivalent objects.   It's the same thing that
  we did  in modular arithmetic.   When we set the base to be 7,
  we made 5, -2, and 12 equivalent.   We then fused them together into a modular number
  [5]=[-2]=[12].
