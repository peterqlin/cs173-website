	<h2>Recursive Definition 2 </h2>
</div>


<h2>Another induction proof with recursive definition</h2>


<p>
Here's another example of a recursive definition:

<ul>
<li>  f(1) = 1
<li>  f(2) = 5
<li>  f(n) = 5f(n-1) - 6f(n-2)
</ul>

  <p>
    This is slightly different from the example in the previous video, in that
    f(n) depends on two previous values of n:  f(n-1) and f(n-2).    This means
    that we need two base cases to get the definition started before we can
    apply the recursive part of the definition.   

  <p>
    In one of the dark alleys around Siebel, a mysterious stranger came up to me and
    whispered this closed form:   
\(f(n) = 3^n - 2^n\).   Let's prove that it's correct.
Specifically, our claim will be that


<blockquote>
Claim:  for all positive integers n, \(f(n) = 3^n - 2^n\).   
</blockquote>

<p>
Our inductive proof will
echo the structure of the recursive definition:  two base cases, two applications of
the inductive hypothesis inside the inductive step.
There are examples where the inductive proof needs to have a slightly different structure (e.g.
more base cases).   However, an extremely good initial assumption is that the two will be
similar.

<p>
So, in particular, we need two base cases.   These should be for the first two values 
of n covered by the claim, i.e. 1 and 2.

<blockquote>
  Proof:   by induction on n.

  <p>
    Base cases:  at n=1, f(n) = f(1) = 1. <br>
    Also, \(3^n - 2^n = 3^1 - 2^1 = 1\).

    <p>
    At n=2, f(n) = f(2) = 5.
    Also, \(3^n - 2^n = 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5\).

    <p>
    In both cases, \(f(n) = 3^n - 2^n\).   

</blockquote>

<p>
  Here's our inductive hypothesis.   Notice that the range of values for the inductive hypothesis
  starts at the first base case.   I'm going to run the range of values up to k-1 (not k) for
  variety.


<blockquote>
Inductive hypothesis:  \(f(n) = 3^n - 2^n\) for \(n=1,2,\ldots, k-1\).   
</blockquote>


<p>
  Now, set up the goal at the end of the inductive step.   Since I ran the inductive hypothesis
  up to n=k-1, our goal will be the claim at n=k.

<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <br> .... <br>

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  As in our previous recursive definition proof, we'll start by using the
  recursive definition to divide our big object f(k) into smaller objects (f applied to smaller
  input values).

<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <p>
    \(f(k) = 5f(k-1) - 6f(k-2) \) (by the definition of f)

  <br> .... <br>

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  Then apply the inductive hypothesis to BOTH of the smaller values of f:

<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <p>
    \(f(k) = 5f(k-1) - 6f(k-2) \) (by the definition of f) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = 5(3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}) - 6(3^{k-2} - 2^{k-2})\) (by the inductive hypothesis) <br>

  <br> .... <br>

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now collect the terms with similar exponential terms:

<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <p>
    \(f(k) = 5f(k-1) - 6f(k-2) \) (by the definition of f) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = 5(3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}) - 6(3^{k-2} - 2^{k-2})\) (by the inductive hypothesis) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = (5\cdot 3^{k-1} - 6\cdot 3^{k-2})   
    - (5\cdot 2^{k-1} - 6\cdot 2^{k-2})\) <br>
    <br>

  <br> .... <br>

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\).
</blockquote>


<p>
Now we're going to steal a factor of 2 or 3 from the 6's:

<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <p>
    \(f(k) = 5f(k-1) - 6f(k-2) \) (by the definition of f) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = 5(3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}) - 6(3^{k-2} - 2^{k-2})\) (by the inductive hypothesis) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = (5\cdot 3^{k-1} - 6\cdot 3^{k-2})   
    - (5\cdot 2^{k-1} - 6\cdot 2^{k-2})\) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = (5\cdot 3^{k-1} - 2\cdot 3^{k-1})   
    - (5\cdot 2^{k-1} - 3\cdot 2^{k-1})\) <br>


  <br> .... <br>

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\).
</blockquote>

<p>
  And now simplify the algebra to finish the middle of the proof:


<blockquote>
  Rest of inductive step:

  <p>
    \(f(k) = 5f(k-1) - 6f(k-2) \) (by the definition of f) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = 5(3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}) - 6(3^{k-2} - 2^{k-2})\) (by the inductive hypothesis) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = (5\cdot 3^{k-1} - 6\cdot 3^{k-2})   
    - (5\cdot 2^{k-1} - 6\cdot 2^{k-2})\) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = (5\cdot 3^{k-1} - 2\cdot 3^{k-1})   
    - (5\cdot 2^{k-1} - 3\cdot 2^{k-1})\) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(       = 3\cdot 3^{k-1} - 2\cdot 2^{k-1} = 3^k - 2^k\) 

  <p>
  So \(f(k) = 3^{k} - 2^{k}\), which is what we needed to prove.
</blockquote>
