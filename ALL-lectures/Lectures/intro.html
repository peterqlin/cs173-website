<h2>Introduction</h2>

<hr />
<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>This course has three goals</p>

<ul>
	<li>Learn how to read and write proofs and formal mathematical notation</li>
	<li>Survey a variety of useful mathematical topics, showing relationships to practical applications</li>
	<li>Introduction to theoretical computer science</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of you are taking this course because it&#39;s required by the CS major, the ECE major, or the CS minor. There&#39;s three main reasons for making you take it</p>

<ul>
	<li>To prepare you for CS 225 (e.g. analyzing running time of algorithms) and CS 374 (which expects you to be able to do proofs).</li>
	<li>You might go into theory. That&#39;s very few of you, but we don&#39;t know who you are yet. And you might not know either.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll probably have theory folks on your team and/or need to use theory reference books</li>
</ul>
