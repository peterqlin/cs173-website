	<h2>Induction 3 </h2>
</div>


<hr>

  <p>
Let's look at a slightly different sort of induction proof.
I'm not going to write this up as a full formal proof.
Let's just at the structure of how the proof will work.


<h2>The claim</h2>

<p>
Here is a picture of a "right triomino."

  <p>
    <img width = 200 src="induction-figs/triomino.png">

  <p>
    Suppose we have a 4x4 checkerboard like this, where someone has
    covered up one square.   In this case, planted a tree there.

  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/checkerboard.png">

  <p>
    We can tile this with right triominos.    By "tile," I mean
    that we can cover it with right triominos, covering each
    square exactly once.

  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/tiling-checkerboard.png">

  <p>
    This also works for an 8x8 checkerboard with the missing square
    in a different position.

  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/tiling2.png">

<p>
  I claim that this works for any square checkerboard whose side
  length is a power of 2.

<h2>The induction variable</h2>

<p>
  Notice that the claim applies to many checkerboards of each size,
  because we can pick any square to be the missing one.   So our
  induction variable n is the <b> size </b> of the checkerboard.
  Each step in the induction will prove that all checkerboards of
  that size will work.

<p>
  Also notice that "size" means the exponent.   So the nth step
  covers checkerboards with sidelength \(2^n\).

<p>
  So we should be careful about stating our claim to make n obvious.
  For example:

  <blockquote>
Claim: for any positive integer n,  any \(2^n\)  by \(2^n\) 
checkerboard with one square missing can be tiled with right
triominos.
  </blockquote>


<h2>The base case</h2>

<p>
  What's the smallest square checkerboard whose side length is a
  power of 2?

<p>
  We could start with the 2x2 checkerboard.   There's four possible
  places to put the missing square.    For each one of them, you can
  cover the other three squares with a right triomino.   However, there
  is a smaller checkerboard of the right type:   a \(2^0\) by \(2^0\)
  checkerboard whose only square is missing.   This can be tiled with
  zero right triominos.


  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/base-case-triominos.png">

  <p>
    OK, better adjust our claim, because zero is not a positive integer.

  <blockquote>
Claim: for any non-negative integer n,  any \(2^n\)  by \(2^n\) 
checkerboard with one square missing can be tiled with right
triominos.
  </blockquote>

<p>
  When working with geometrical objects like this, the best way to present
  the base case often involves pictures.

<p>
  For a proof, it's enough to show the smallest base case, i.e. the 1 by 1 checkerboard.
  However, it's not wrong to add a second base case for the 2 by 2 checkerboards, to help
  the reader understand.
  Extra base cases are fine as long as they don't get too long and make the proof hard
  to read.   Or you could do the proof with just the smallest checkerboard, but then show
  the reader some supplementary pictures of several small sizes of checkerboard.

<h2>The inductive hypothesis</h2>

<p>
  Our inductive hypothesis is that the claim holds for any checkerboard
  up to some bound k.   More precisely...

  <blockquote>
    Inductive hypothesis: any \(2^n\) by \(2^n\) checkerboard 
    with one square missing can be tiled with right triominos, for
    n = 0, ..., k.
  </blockquote>

<h2>The inductive step</h2>

<p>
  The big trick is the inductive step.   We can divide any
  \(2^n\) by \(2^n\) checkerboard into four smaller checkerboards,
  each with side length
  \(2^{n-1}\).

  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/dividing-checkerboard.png">

  <p>
    One of these four small checkerboards is missing a square.   We can
    force the other three to be missing a square by placing a single
    right triomino in the middle.


  <p>
    <img width = 300 src="induction-figs/recursive-tiling.png">


  <p>
    Now we use our inductive hypothesis on each of the small checkerboards.
    Each of them can be tiled with right triominos.   And then we
    can make a tiling for the big checkerboard using those tiling, plus
    the one triomino that we put in the middle.

  <p>
    So we've shown that if the inductive hypothesis is true, i.e. we can
    tile the smaller checkerboards, then     we can also tile the larger
    checkerboard.   That's our goal at the end of the inductive step.

<h2>Connection to programs</h2>

<p>
  It's perhaps more compelling to think of this as the design for a
  computer program that would tile checkerboard for you.   The place
  where we invoke the inductive hypothesis in the proof is exactly where
  your program would do a recursive function call.
