Let's look at the formal definition of "onto" and how to do proofs
involving onto.

<h2>Definition of onto
</h2>

  <p>
    Suppose we have a function \(f: A \rightarrow B\).
A is the "domain" and B is the "co-domain".

<p>
<img width=300 src="functions-figs/image-of-function.png">

<p>
The "image" of f is the set of all values that f actually produces,
if we feed all the input values from A into f.   It's often
written f(A).  The type signature for f requires that output values
live in B.   So f(A) is always a subset of B.   f is "onto"
if f(A) is equal to B.   That is, f actually produces all the values
in B.

<blockquote>
<p>
\(f: A \rightarrow B\) is onto if and only if

  <ul>
    <li> image = co-domain
      </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  We can expand this definition a bit by defining the term "pre-image."
  A preimage of an element of the co-domain is a value from the domain
  that maps onto it.   For example, in the picture below, 3 is a pre-image
  of b.   Notice that a has two pre-images and c has no pre-images.

<p>
<img width=300 src="functions-figs/preimage.png">
 
<blockquote>
<p>
\(f: A \rightarrow B\) is onto if and only if

  <ul>
<li> image = co-domain
<li> for all y in B, y has a pre-image (i.e. at least one)
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And we can expand the definition into even more detail by substituting
  the definition of pre-image:

<blockquote>
<p>
\(f: A \rightarrow B\) is onto if and only if

  <ul>
<li> image = co-domain
<li> for all y in B, y has a pre-image 
<li> for all y in B, there is an x in A such that f(x) = y
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The first version is most useful for undertanding the concept.   The
  last version gives us an explicit pattern for writing a proof.

<h2> Quantifier order matters
</h2>

<p>
  Notice that the definition of "onto" starts with two quantifiers that
  are different:  the first is universal and the second is existential.
  With mismatched quantifiers like this, the order matters.  Consider this
  example:
  
<blockquote>
     (a) There is a dining hall where all the students eat. <br>
     (b)  Every student has a dining hall where he eats.
</blockquote>

<p>
  When interpreting sequences of quantifiers, we pick values reading left to right.
  In sentence (a), we first pick a dining hall D and this choice of D has to work
  for all students that we might select.   This might be true at a small college
  that has only one dining hall.

  <p>
    In sentence (b), we pick the student first and then we pick the dining hall.
    So our choice of dining hall can depend on the student.  So (b) will be true
    for a lot more schools, because it's ok to have some students eating at one
    dining hall and some eating  at a different one.

<p>
  You can think of these "nested" quantifiers as a type of game.   When you read
  left to right, you get to pick values for existential quantifiers and your
  adversary picks the ones for universal quantifiers.   So, in the dining hall
  example, your job is much easier if you get to pick second, after you've seen
  what your adversary is choosing.


<h2> Onto proof </h2>

<p>
Now, consider this claim:

<blockquote>
   Let \(f: \mathbb{Z}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(f(x,y) = 2x + 3y\) <br>
   Claim:  f is onto.
</blockquote>

<p>
Proofs of "onto" are typically constructed backwards, and then rewritten into forwards order.
We need to sort-of invert the function f.   By "sort of," I mean that we don't need a real inverse
function but we just need a way to construct pre-images.

<blockquote>
  <b>Scratch paper</b> <br>
  
 <p>
 How to get 7 as output?   input (2,1)

 <p>
   How to get 1 as output?   input (-1,1)  or (2, -1) or ...

 <p>
   How to get k as output?   input (-k, k) or (2k, -k)

</blockquote>

<p>
For our proof, we only need a single way to pick a pre-image for each output value k.
So let's use (-k, k)     

<p>
Our final proof outline mirrors the definition of "onto":
"for all y in B, there is an x in A such that f(x) = y".   Oh, but the inputs to our
function have the form (x,y).   So let's rewrite this with variable names that match
up with our function definition:

<blockquote>
For all k in B, there is an (x,y) in A such that f(x,y) = k.  
</blockquote>


<p>
  To write the proof in proper logical order,
  we choose an arbitrary value for the output value (k).   We then pull the
  corresponding input value out of thin air, and then explain to the reader why it's a
  pre-image of k.   So it looks like this:


<blockquote>
Proof:  Let \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\).
<p>
        Consider \((-k,k) \in \mathbb{Z}^2\).

<p>
\(f(-k,k) = 2(-k) + 3k = k\).
  So (-k,k) is a pre-image of k.
<p>
  Since k was arbitrarily chosen, this means that every value k has a pre-image.  So f is onto.
</blockquote>

<p>
We're able to pull the pre-image out of thin air because of the
preliminary work that we did on our scratch paper.
Onto proofs are often relatively simple, but it's important to realize
that they involve backwards scratch work that doesn't appear in the final
formal proof.
