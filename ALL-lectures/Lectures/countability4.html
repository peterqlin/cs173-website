	<h2>Countability 4 </h2>
</div>


<hr>
<h2>More functions than formulas</h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Let's recall two facts from previous videos:

  <ul>
  <li> There are uncountably many functions from \(\mathbb{N}\) to {0,1}
  <li> There are only countably many finite-length strings of text.
  </ul>

<p>
  The mathematical formulas we typically use to define functions are finite-length
  strings of text.    Computer programs are also finite-length strings of text.
  So 

  <ul>
  <li> There are only countably many mathematical formulas.
  <li> There are only countably many computer programs.
  </ul>

<p>
  So there are more functions than there are formulas or computer programs.
  This implies that there are functions for which we can't write a formula or
  compute the function using a computer program.

<p>
  This is definitely a non-constructive proof.   I have no way to describe
  what these functions are, precisely because they don't have finite-length
  decriptions.   We do know that they can't have a pattern that repeats as
  the input value heads out towards infinity.


<hr>
<h2>The Halting Problem</h2>
<hr>


<p>
  Here is a specific example of a problem for which we cannot build a program:

<blockquote>
 The Halting Problem: Given the text for a program P, decide whether P eventually halts.
</blockquote>

<p>
  It's impossible to write an algorithm to solve this task.   The proof is beyond the scope
  of this course.  But it's done with a modification of the diagonalization idea that we
  used to prove that certain sets are uncountable.

<p>
  Notice that we're talking about whether we can write a <b> fully general</b> algorithm
  that will work on any input program P, even nasty bits of spaghetti code.
  Obviously we can write an algorithm that will find the answer in many cases.


<p>
  There are three ways that a program could behave as it runs:

  <ul>
<li>  Halts.
<li>  Loops:  repeats the same memory state.   
<li>  Continues without Looping:  never halts and never repeats the same memory state.
  </ul>

<p>
  The problem is difficult because of the third case.
  If we only had to worry about the first two cases, our algorithm could simply watch
  the state of the program P.   After some finite amount of time, P would have to halt
  or repeat a memory state.   

<p>
  If a program has a limit on how much memory it can use, it must eventually halt or
  loop.   So, technically, a real-world program can't continue forever without looping.
  However, in practice, a typical computer has enough memory that a program can spend
  a vast amount of time running without repeating the same memory state.


<p>
  You can see the same three-way behavior pattern in other examples involving
  uncountable sets or or uncomputable questions:

  <ul>
  <li> rational vs. irrational numers (digits of an irrational continue forever without looping)
  <li> Conway's Game of Life:  glider guns continue forever without repeating a pattern
  </ul>

<h2>Periodic tilings</h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Now, let's think about the problem of covering the plane with a finite set of tiles.
  It's relatively easy to make a pattern that repeats in a regular way, using either a single
  shape or a finite set of shapes.   

<p>
  <img width=200 src="countability-figs/regular-tiling.png">

  <br>
  from Wikipedia

<p>
  These repeating patterns are called "periodic tilings".  
  Since ancient times, they have been used to make pretty patterns on
floors and walls using ceramic tiles.

<p>

<p>
If you cut out a rectangle of appropriate size, you
  can make the whole pattern by making copies of whatever is on the rectangle.
This is how modern builders often use cheap materials to simulate the look 
of fancy ceramic tiles.

  <img width=200 src="countability-figs/repeat-rectangle.png">

<p>
  Certain shapes and sets of shapes can't cover the whole plan.   For example, if you
  try to cover the plan with copies of a single regular pentagon, you quickly get stuck with a situation
  where you have a gap that you can't fill.   


<p>
  <img width=200 src="countability-figs/pentagons-cant-tile.png">

<p>
  These repeating and self-stopping
  patterns are like two of our program behaviors:   looping and halting.
  Can we also make sets of tiles that can cover the entire plane, but without having a 
  rectangular section that repeats?   Those are called "aperiodic tilings" and
  are like our third program behavior.

<hr>
<h2>Aperiodic tilings </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Research on aperiodic tilings started with Hao Wang.   In 1961, he defined
  a class of square tiles with labels on their edges.   These are usually
  displayed in pretty form with colors:


<p>
<img width=200 src="countability-figs/wang-tiles1.png">

  <p>
  When these tiles are placed on the plane, adjacent sides must have the same color:

<p>
<img width=150 src="countability-figs/wang-tiles2.png">

  <p>
    Hao Wang's question is whether there were sets of tiles that could cover the whole
    plane but couldn't do it in a periodic way.
    In 1966, Robert Berger created a set of 20,426 Wang tiles that cover the plane only
    aperiodically.   Various researchers stripped this down and eventually found a
    set of 11 tiles with this property

<p>
Around 1973-74, Roger Penrose figured out how to make 
pretty aperiodic tilings using small sets of geometric shapes.

<p>
  Around the same time (1971), 
Raphael Robinson showed that it was possible to similate a 
Turing Machine (very simple computer) using sets of Wang tiles.
  As we saw with the Game of Life, the potential for aperiodic
  behavior goes hand-in-hand with the ability to simulate a computer.


<p>
At SIGGRAPH in 2003, a group of graphics researchers 
(Michael F. Cohen, Jonathan Shade, Stefan Hiller, Oliver Deussen)
showed how to use Wang tiles to cheaply produce natural-looking 
textures using Wang tiles:

<h2>Quasicrystals</h2>
<hr>

<p>
An interesting feature of Penrose tilings is that they can be used to make patterns
with many types of rotational symmetry.

<p>
  Standard crystal structures in chemistry can produce only four types of
  rotational symmetr:   2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold.
  In 1982, a chemist named Dan Shechtman observed a crystal structure with
  a 5-fold rotational symmetry, in an alloy of manganese and aluminum.
  A similar diffraction pattern with a 10-fold symmetry is shown below.
  These were eventually named "quasicrystals".

<p>
As detailed in this
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/06/dan-shechtman-nobel-prize-chemistry-interview">
interview with The Guardian newspaper</a>,
the head of Shechtman's lab at NIST said he was a disgrace and
kicked him out of the group.

<blockquote>
 "Danny, you are a disgrace to my group. I cannot be with you in the same group."
 <br>
 Head of Shechtman's lab at NIST
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 "Danny Shechtman is talking nonsense, there are no quasi-crystals, just quasi-scientists."
<br>
    Linus Pauling
</blockquote>


<p>
However, other folks replicated his observations.
In 2008-2011 Luca Bindi and Paul Steinhardt tracked down natural examples of
quasicrystals.
In 2011, 
Shechtman was given the Nobel prize in Chemistry. 
Given the close connections between the Halting Problem and quasicrystals,
this is arguably the closest Nobel prize to computer science.
