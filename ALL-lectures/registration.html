<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>If you still need to join the class and it is currently full:</p>

<ul>
	<li>CS majors: the department holds back some seats for late-registering majors. Contact the CS academic office.</li>
	<li>CE students who need this course now to graduate on time: speak to an ECE advisor who will, if appropriate, contact the CS academic office.</li>
	<li>Others: keep an eye on the registration system. People do drop, and we&#39;ll release any held-back seats around the start of classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seats in this course can appear quite late, even during the first couple weeks of classes. For example, students who pass the CS 173 proficiency exam (and can therefore drop the course) won&#39;t find this out until about a week into classes. Don&#39;t give up until we&#39;re past the 10th day of classes. (We do not let students join the class or switch lecture after the 10th day.)</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t yet registered when clases start, <font color="red"> COME TO CLASS</font> and stay caught up with the work. Otherwise, it will be difficult to get caught up when you are able to add the course officially.</p>

<h3>Prerequisite checking</h3>

<p>This course assumes that you have significant practice with recursion, have worked with basic data structures (e.g. linked lists, trees or graphs), and have seen simple examples of big-O algorithm analysis. Students without this background sometimes think they are ok towards the start of the term, but get into trouble midway through the course.</p>

<p>To take this course, you must have completed Calculus I (Math 220 or 221) and CS 125 or ECE 220. Banner is now enforcing these prerequisites automatically, so you will not be able to add CS 173 if you don&#39;t have them.</p>

<p>If you have credit for a prerequisite course but it is not visible on your transcript, you must speak to the CS academic office for an override. This would include students with incoming transfer credit, exchange students, and students who pass the CS 125 proficiency exam at the start of the term. Be aware that the academic office is swamped during registration and also at the start of the term, so be patient especially if you are a non-major.</p>

<p>What can be used to satisfy the prerequisites?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Since registration happens in the middle of the previous term, you&#39;ll be allowed to register for CS 173 based on the fact that you&#39;re currently taking the prerequisite course(s). If you fail a prerequisite class, you&#39;ll have to drop CS 173.</li>
	<li>You can take CS 173 if you have credit for Calculus II or III, but mysteriously no credit for Calculus I. However, you should see your advisor to sort out your situation if your major (e.g. CS) explicitly requires Calculus I for graduation.</li>
	<li>You cannot satisfy the programming requirement using AP CS, CS 101/105, and/or ECE 120. These courses do not cover some of the critical background material.</li>
	<li>You may not take a prerequisite course (e.g. CS 125 or ECE 220) concurrently with CS 173. CS 173 uses certain critical material before these courses cover it.</li>
	<li>Having taken much of a prerequisite course (e.g. Calc I) in high school does not change this rule. If you cannot place out of the course at U. Illinois, that means you don&#39;t have the background to take CS 173.</li>
	<li>You may satisfy the intro programming requirement by passing the <a href="https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/"> CS 125 proficiency exam</a><a> (in C++ or Java), at the start of term. Have a backup plan in case you don&#39;t pass it. </a></li>
	<li><a> It is also sufficient if you pass the ECE 220 proficiency exam at the start of term. (The ECE department gives this only by special arrangement, primarily to transfer students.) </a></li>
</ul>
