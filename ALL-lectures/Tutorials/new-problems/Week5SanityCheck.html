<h1>7.5c sanity check</h1>

<div class="sh-color-black sh-color" style="font-family: &quot;Superhuman Adelle Email&quot;, color-emoji-override, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 14px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); line-height: 24px !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased !important;">- Find a counterexample to show that discussion manual problem 7.5c would be broken/unsolvable if the numbers 61 and 10 were replaced by 19 and 3. That is, prove that the following claim is <em>false</em>: &quot;If a software engineer slept for 19 hours over 3 nights, then&nbsp;assuming that the engineer sleeps precisely an integer number of hours each night, on some pair of consecutive nights she slept at least 13 hours.&quot;)</div>

(If it can, then your original proof also has a flaw; try to find it.)</div>
