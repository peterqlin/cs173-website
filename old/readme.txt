Welcome to the Spring 2021 folder for your course!

This folder can be a home for your course website or it can provide 
an automatically generated landing page with basic information generated
from campus-provided data.  For some courses, your department may provide
additional course profile information that will appear on this default
landing page.

If you want to create a site here, start by creating an html page. Name
it index.html, index.php, or index.asp to make it the default document
people will see when visiting your course website.  This will replace the
default landing page with your own content.

If you have materials that you want restricted to students registered in
your class, drop them in the secure folder.

If you would like to redirect this site to another website entirely, please
visit https://my.engr.illinois.edu/webedit.  Click on your course, select the
proper semester and specify a URL for the redirect.

For questions regarding this service, please contact grainger-marcom@illinois.edu.
