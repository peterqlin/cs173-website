<h1>CS 173 Honors Add-on</h1>

<p>This add-on is is intended for students with strong background, e.g. James scholar and/or a strong GPA plus an A in the prerequisite courses.</p>

<p>The honors add-on does not have its own meeting time. Announcements are made via the regular CS 173 lectures and Piazza. Students taking the honors add-on will be required to view additional lectures on extra material and do additional homework problems. You can ask questions about honors material in normal 173 office hours held by Ben, Aryan, Anisha, Aarushi, or Ethan; other course staff may not be familiar with the honors material and so may be unable to help.</p>

<p>Preference will be given to James scholars, since their program requires them to do an honors course. But there are usually spare seats, in which case we&#39;ll let in other folks by special permission.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>All the students in the honors add-on do the same extra work. However, the James scholar programs in different colleges want the paperwork done in different ways. This system has changed frequently so the info below may be out of date, but my understanding is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are taking the honors add-on as part of an honors requirement (e.g. for the James scholars program), ask the honors office for your college how they want the paperwork done; it will probably involve an&nbsp;EHCLA (electronic honors credit learning agreement) or something similar, and NOT&nbsp;registering for CS 199.&nbsp;When filling out an HCLA, the HCLA should be for CS 173 (3sh), <strong>not</strong> for CS 199. When the form asks you to describe the extra work, say that you&#39;ll complete the assignments for CS 199, section 173. The instructor should ideally be Benjamin Cosman (bcosman), though if it only gives the option to select Payam then just do that.</li>
	<li>If you are taking the honors add-on because you feel like it, register for CS 199&nbsp;section 173 (0 or 1 sh). [Currently some sources incorrectly call CS 199 &quot;Applied Cloud Computing&quot;, but section 173 should still be labeled correctly as &quot;Supplementary proj for CS-173&quot;.]&nbsp;Be careful not to register for the wrong section of 199, which will be the honors add-on for a totally different class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some colleges have been known to change these details from one year to the next. If your college&#39;s honors office tells you something different from the above, please tell us right away so we can clarify the instructions for all students in your college.</p>
